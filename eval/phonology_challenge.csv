3,As the holly groweth green,With ivy all alone,When flowers cannot be seen,"And greenwood leaves be gone,",1
4,The sea and wind do then obey,"And sighing, sighing double notes","Of double basses, content to play",A droning chord for the little throats,1

43,The heart and service to you proffer'd,"With right good will full honestly,","Refuse it not, since it is offer'd,",But take it to you gentlely.,1
44,Here the anthem doth commence:,Love and constancy is dead;,Phoenix and the Turtle fled,In a mutual flame from hence.,1
45,It sits looking,over harbor and city,on silent haunches,and then moves on.,1
46,"So they lov'd, as love in twain",Had the essence but in one;,"Two distincts, division none:",Number there in love was slain.,1
47,I have lovd her all my youth;,"But now old, as you see,",Love likes not the falling fruit,From the withered tree.,1
